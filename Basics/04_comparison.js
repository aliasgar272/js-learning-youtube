// Converts string into int to check
console.log("2"> 1);

// // Comparison operator >, < == and Equality operator work differently than each other
// In Comparison null is considered as a number i.e 0.  thats why null >= 0 is true

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0); // doesnt treat null as 0
console.log(null >= 0);
console.log(null <= 0);


// === / strict check. Checks the datatype as well

console.log(2 === 2);
console.log("2" === 2);
